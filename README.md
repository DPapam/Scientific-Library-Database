# Scientific-Library-Database

Application for Storage and Retrieval of Articles and Scientific Journals

The topic of the project was to create a database that would provide access to scientific journals and articles to users who register with it.

Installation Instructions:

To use the application, the following are needed:

•	Python 3.10 or later version as functions not available in older versions are used.

•	The sqlite3 library used for communication between the application and the database and for executing SQL commands.

To start the application, the files need to be downloaded, placed in the same folder, and the program start_program.py needs to be run. Once executed, we will have the option either to read files or to add files to our database (Scientific_Library.db) after registration in the application.
